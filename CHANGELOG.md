<summary>Historical Change Log</summary>

#### Version 6.3.0 _(2019-02-04)_

- Specified a custom `User-Agent` to explicitly identify ourselves to the
  `haveibeenpwned.com` API ([9185536d][9185536d])

#### Version 6.2.0 _(2019-01-19)_

- Added `-i`/`--include-unverified` option to `ba` command to include
  "unverified" breaches in the results
- Converted to TypeScript ([#26][26])

#### Version 6.1.2 _(2018-12-20)_

- Moved coverage reports from Coveralls to Codecov ([#24][24])
- Moved CI from Travis to Circle ([#25][25])

#### Version 6.1.1 _(2018-06-26)_

- Updated dependencies (includes fix for `Forbidden` errors from `hibp@7.1.3`)

#### Version 6.1.0 _(2018-05-23)_

- Made the progress spinner animation a little more fun and added status emojis
  (✔, ⚠, ✖) to some output ([#11][11])

#### Version 6.0.0 _(2018-03-13)_

- Upgraded `hibp` to v7 which handles password hashing and suffix processing,
  removing this logic from `pwned`.
- The `pw` command now includes a count in the output, indicating how many times
  the given password was exposed in a breach.

##### Breaking Changes:

- Dropped support for Node < 6

#### Version 5.0.0 _(2018-02-25)_

- Refactored `pw` command to be secure by default (#8). Passwords will no longer
  be sent over the network. Instead, the first 5 characters of the SHA-1 hash of
  the password will be sent, and the list of suffixes that match the submitted
  prefix will be returned. `pwned` will then search the range of suffixes for
  the suffix from your hash. If a match is found, the password has been
  compromised in a breach.

##### Breaking Changes:

- The `pw` command no longer takes the `-s` (`--sha1`) option. Instead, all
  passwords will be taken literally and hashed. This is due to a remote API
  endpoint change which no longer performs automatic hash detection.

#### Version 4.0.3 _(2017-12-07)_

- Updated `hibp` to avoid Chromium download when running with `npx`

- Updated examples in README to reflect 2.0.0 changes

#### Version 2.0.0 _(2016-08-07)_

- Removed spinner output when command completes

  _This is technically a breaking change as the output for the same input will
  be different than in previous versions. Previously, the progress spinner was
  included in the output (unless using the `--raw` option) and now it isn't. So,
  if you were previously parsing the **formatted** (non-raw) output, you may
  need to adjust._

- Shortened error messages

  _In the event of a failed request to the remote API (network errors, etc.), an
  error message is written to `stderr`. Due to an upstream change in the
  underlying network request technology in the `hibp` library, these messages
  will be significantly shorter as only the "reason" will be displayed now as
  opposed to a more verbose explanation of what went wrong._
