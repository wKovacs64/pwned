### Major Changes

- [`581d0dc4`](https://github.com/wKovacs64/pwned/commit/581d0dc4dc7d3e796866003c116d5ca44da838b4) and [`1bd53262`](https://github.com/wKovacs64/pwned/commit/1bd532629446b5f9b72aac6ff82c5bafc9caa2fb) Thanks [@wKovacs64](https://github.com/wKovacs64)! - Drop support for Node.js 10 and 12 as they are both [end-of-life](https://nodejs.org/en/about/releases/), making the new minimum Node.js runtime v14.13.1. This also converts the project to pure ESM as it is fully supported in 14.13.1, 16 and beyond. Please upgrade your Node.js environment if necessary, or continue using the latest v9 release of `pwned` if you are unable to upgrade your environment.
