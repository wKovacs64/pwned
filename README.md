  Title:       Adobe
  Name:        Adobe
  Domain:      adobe.com
  BreachDate:  2013-10-04
  AddedDate:   2013-12-04T00:00:00Z
  PwnCount:    152445165
  Description: In October 2013, 153 million Adobe accounts were breached with each containing an internal ID, username, email, <em>encrypted</em> password and a password hint in plain text. The password cryptography was poorly done and <a href="http://stricture-group.com/files/adobe-top100.txt" target="_blank">many were quickly resolved back to plain text</a>. The unencrypted hints also <a href="http://www.troyhunt.com/2013/11/adobe-credentials-and-serious.html" target="_blank">disclosed much about the passwords</a> adding further to the risk that hundreds of millions of Adobe customers already faced.
  DataClasses:
    - Email addresses
    - Password hints
    - Passwords
    - Usernames
  IsVerified:  true
  IsSensitive: false

Get a single breached site by breach name:
